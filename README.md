# Linux Practice

Hello you, person checking out my Github projects!

This is a simple project of mine in order to learn and practice about Azure's VM.
Basically this means I'm updating this repo from a remote acess virtual machine from Microsoft Azure.
Not much more than this!

The process has been pretty straightfoward, regardless of some issues I've dealt along the way.
The most challenging part I can tell (i guess) was creating and connecting to the VM.
Although Microsoft has a really clean interface to create VMs, I was pretty overwhelmed by the ammount of information in order to correctly set the VM.

After that, connecting was a bit annoying aswell, mainly because of the SSH private key that I was awkwardly failling to connect, but after that it was pretty simple.

Now I'm working on to upload a simple python project, just to populate a bit this VM I've set up. It's being pretty fun!

And I guess thats it. Hope you enjoy (maybe)! :)
